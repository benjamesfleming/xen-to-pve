# xen-to-pve
XenServer to Proxmox direct export script.

With this script is possible to export a XenServer DomU to a raw proxmox image without the need to extract export tarball and rebuild the final disk image from each chunks. This script does everything on-the-fly in a single pass.

PRs are welcome.
